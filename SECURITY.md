# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Vörsight, please report it responsibly.

**Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please contact the maintainers privately:

- **Email**: Create a security advisory through GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](../../security/advisories/new)
- **Alternatively**: Open a draft security advisory in this repository

We take security seriously and will respond to valid reports as quickly as possible.

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us address the issue quickly, please include:

1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
4. **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
5. **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the latest release only. Please ensure you're using the most recent version before reporting an issue.
